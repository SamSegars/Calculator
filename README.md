# Calculator
First C++ program. Attempt to make a calculator with addition, subtraction, mulitplication, as well as division. (WIP)
Multiply is the only thing that works at the moment, it will prompt for you to select however it will always pick multiplication.
If you would like to use simply input "git clone https://github.com/SamSegars/Calculator.git" into your command line then compile.
